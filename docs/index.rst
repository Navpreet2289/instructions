All developers are doing the same thing everyday - they're searching for some values inside
iterable data structures, trying to filter them somehow or count elements inside which satisfy
some requirements. We keep writing the same code over and over again from project to project.
There's no more need to do this, Instructions to the rescue. Instructions is a library, written
in Python to simplify lives of Python developers. This is how we could write some code using
Instructions which searches for a string with a length of 3 inside a list of values:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> instructions.findstring__len(3).inside(['foo', 'bar', 'blah', 1, 2])

Instructions does all the hard work for you, just tell it what do you want to do in plain english
and it will magically execute your instruction.
